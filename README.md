# Build Your Own Personal Site
_(from Scratch, for free, in about an hour ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ )_

This tutorial will get your hands a little dirty with some code so that you can end up with your own personal site. Try it yourself! Everything you need to get started is below. You don't need prior experience with code to do this. There's also a community of people here and online who can help at every turn :+1:

# Tutorial

This is a jumping off point for people who would like to have their own personal website built from scratch. In this case, from scratch means using code instead of using more visual editors online. You might be asking, why would we put ourselves through touching code instead of using visual editors? A couple reasons:

- Price ðŸ’°
    - The first reason is price. You can get something online for free, granted you're fine with a pretty random URL (mine looks like [arcane-retreat-46709.herokuapp.com](https://arcane-retreat-46709.herokuapp.com/)). This comes from [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), the free cloud provider we're using. You can pay Heroku for things like faster loading times, but for us the free tier will probably work! Then what's left is the [price of the domain name](https://domains.google/). You can get domains pretty cheap nowadays, as long as you're not too picky and a little bit creative! See for yourself! If you search a domain, the annual costs are still pennies on the dollar. For example, jordanbuzzell.com is 12$/year!

- Customizability ðŸ•º 
    - The second motivation is customizability. We're building everything from scratch, so you have full reign over the HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. Granted you follow the rules when it comes to licensing and giving credit where credit is due, you have access to the entire ecosystem of open source templates online. Take my personal example site:

:point_up: this was made using the ['Identity' template](https://html5up.net/identity) from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). As long as [proper credit is given](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), this is free to use and modify. Licenses vary based on the template! So you have to be vigilent not to steal anyone's intellectual property. Beyond that, most of the work is just updating a template that you like to mirror your own vision! You are also entirely free to upload your own HTML, CSS, and JS files. **NOTE**: We won't go over how to code in HTML, CSS, JS, but we will go over some basics just so we can edit the templates.
